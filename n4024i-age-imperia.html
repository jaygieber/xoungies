This isn't a list of political content, but more a repository of decent quality stuff which won't surprise you with reactionary takes out of the blue (I think we've all been there). Clarifications re: category. Lore is a focus on narrative from the games. 
- Age of Empires 3: The Asian Dynasties. Это дополнение обладает так же новыми нациями, но представлены они населением восточных земель, добавлены так же более десятка новых чудес света для строительства, улучшена и изменена торговля, появятся для выбора новые шаблоны для создания карты. In what appears to be a pilot gone rogue, Sue Abbott defied corp and alliance leadership by anchoring several small citadels around the BWF-ZZ gate in Oijanen today, prompting PanFam to batphone Black Legion at one point for assistance in destroying the anchoring Raitarus. Once again, TEST military leadership said they had no idea the citadels were anchoring today and did not care. When reached on Discord, High Commander Progodlegend said, “Look, you idiot.

Arnett (2008) published an analysis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18855491) of the psychology literature in major journals from 2003 to 2007 and found that 68% of studies were done on American subjects and 96% were on industrialized Western subjects. So really, what we know about human psychology is only about humans living in industrialized Western nations; to the extent that those kinds of humans differ from other kinds of humans we have limited information about the other kinds. · www.imperial-age.com Запись интернет-конференции Аора от 22 апреля 2014 года. It is the 42nd Millennium, and the galaxy is dying. A great wound in realspace had been inflicted by the hands of the Great Enemy. To attempt to comprehend the sheer volume of suffering and destruction would be to surrender to the Enemy's depredations. Nowhere is safe, not even on Holy Terra, crown jewel of an Empire that has endured for ten thousand years. The Lord Guilliman sat pensive in his private chambers. It was a massive room, decorated in the finery of a thousand worlds, its accoutre.

TLDR: So, I just finished my first game of Stellaris. Here's a write-up of the "historical record" of my race. For a little OOC information, the Voxar were the custom species I used to use in Pax Imperia (Pax Imperia is basically a very primitive and feature incomplete version of Stellaris from the 90's) and I attempted to recreate them as closely as I could in Stellaris. This game was with the largest size 2 arm spiral galaxy possible to be created. I started with a random number of regular.

It takes place in the world of Carna, specifically the continent of Alera, where a civilization has been built by the descendants of a lost Roman Legion. Using elemental abilities granted by their bond with Furies, creatures native to Carna, the Alerans defend themselves from other fantastical races in Carna, as well as deal with treachery and political maneuvering within the realm. Think of it as a mix between. I wonder if people still look into this reddit. In the past I collected games till 5 years ago when my room was packed full with big boxes. Now a time has come which I never thought would arrive. I enjoyed watching them for years picking them up from the shelf, reliving the history of the age when the artwork drew you into a store and looked at the back of a big box and looked at all the screenshots and read all the stuff the publisher wrote to make it interesting. Back then I had no internet. Hey, gamers, long time browser of this MMO community. I share many of your opinions about recent MMOs, and I'm just wondering what your go-to game is and what MMOs are keeping you interested nowadays. As far as my tastes, I'm looking for a non-p2w open world MMORPG with fluid combat and a strong, extremely large, friendly community. As far as my tastes, I have an opinion on a few recent MMOs. Guardian Hunter is shit. StarCraft Universe is shit. Ironsight is shit. Star Citizen is shit. After a week off due to E3 it’s time to get back to researching the developers of games. Metroid Prime was recommended a few times in previous threads and during the research of this thread Metroid Prime 4 (which won’t be developed by Retro) was announced. The Shadow of the Colossus remake was also announced which is being made by Bluepoint (founded by former Retro people). This is only a list of people who worked on the game as part of Retro.

Sergei sat in his chair, idly staring at the wall. His eyes were half open and his arms hung at his side. He glanced at a few books piled at the corner of his room and briefly thought about reading them. Sergei’s bed was across the hall and forcing himself into it seemed like too much work. The irony of being too tired to get into bed wasn’t lost on him. There was nothing else to do, nothing else to say, just to sleep. He rested his head on his shoulder, closed his eyes and drifted off. Sergei’. So I was playing Commonwealth of Man. My galactic neighborhood was shrinking and I found two systems, one with early space and the other steam. The early space was in an uninhabitable world for humans, but I didn't want new rivals, especially with militant United Kharak Kiith and Imperia Sol Invicticus neighbouring nearby. So I bombarded it until it became colonizable (but not to humans). The steam age world was in an ocean world, excellent for colonization. So I used orbital bombardment. I am Colonel James Hsu with the NCR Army, Ret and now write about the fascinating military history of the Wastes, a history I was privy to on many occasions. While you may have read many a tome on the early rise of the Republic and its destiny to expand across Old America, I will instead write about a more.taboo topic still rarely talked about even in the darkest alleys of the Boneyard. I am of course talking about the shocking and meteoric rise of Caesar's Legion. Its victories, its defeats. 
##NEWS Aeras isn't done yet, but we are moving close to endgame territory, so our large empires seem intent on snatching up more land while they can. It's all in the interest of maintaining peace, I'm sure. With respect to voting for our new Shard, the results from last week are in. People are pretty strongly agreed on having no magic , but there will be opportunity for lots of crazy science. With regards to FTL, which has been our stickiest point of discussion, people voted for Starcraft. First off, I'd like to note that I found this study ( through the Medium article (https://medium.com/@cainejw/dishonesty-feminist-frequency-part-1-fe937f6a791e) that was posted here earlier by user Rocket_McGrain. The article states that the study "find s that men who rate video game play as sexist scored higher on measurements of benevolent sexism." ##NEWS The war continues, and another Schedule Sunday has come where I have basically nothing new to report. That's not to say things aren't active. Things are still very active, thanks to our relentlessly awesome cabal of players. But nothing catastrophic or world-changing has happened lately, and I'm finding a wartime newsreel a bit tough to manage. WAR-TIME NEWS REEL Kalrisia has declared an embargo on the Freedom Federation The Battle of Nirene has concluded. The Neen are concern. ##NEWS We had our first Meeting of Nations and everyone seems to be getting along quite nicely. ##CLOCK Current time: Year 5 of the Common Era. Limit: 15 CE (The clock is usually set to whatever the latest date is of a post made during the previous week) ##WEEKLY EVENTS Each week we will have days designated for special events. These events will either be large-scale interactive prompts or spotlight posts on a single person's nation that has greater depth than a typical lore post. By Andrew Caulfield “Like father, like son” is a phrase that held good when Mshawish contested the GI Donn H. three days ago. In powering clear in this Grade I dirt contest, the 6-year-old emulated his sire Medaglia d’Oro, winner of the 2004 Donn as a prelude to his second in Pleasantly Perfect’s G1 Dubai World Cup. There is, though, one major difference between the two. Whereas Medaglia d’Oro never tackled turf, his son was having only his third start on the main track. Having made his debut. I am back from Taiwan and still alive for another week! ##NEWS War continues to be over. Everyone is busy reorganizing their governments and acquiring new territory before the inevitable and incipient end of this world as we know it. (Just wait and see for that one). Another round of voting is up for the next shard. Please locate the link at the bottom of this post. ##CLOCK Current time: Year 44 of the Common Era. Limit: 54 CE (The clock is usually set to whatever the latest ##NEWS We have had some new folks join our ranks. And a couple estranged players have returned to us. Welcome to you all.
