                            <p>I have the 2011 Skyrim (not remastered) Legendary Edition and i‘m playing on UWQHD (3440x1440) 120FPS/Hz. Without mods i hit constantly more than 100FPS, sometimes drops to 87-90, but that is not really a problem. Now i downloaded the ENBdev newest version and the antifreeze patch + the Realvision ENB upgrade and i get in some Areas FPS drops to 40. In Interiors i have 100-120FPS thats alright, but if i‘m in a city it drops often to 40-50. I mean. wtf?! Its a 2011 Game and i have a GTX 1080Ti. I installed the game and there was no problem. I modded it, now the game doest display the particles. When casting Flames spell, I dont see the fire effect, for example. Runes on the ground are invisible also, so I keep stepping on them. Things I have tried to fix it (they didnt work): The antifreeze ENB patch (even though I dont use any enbs) iMaxParticles editing MaxDecals editing Messing around with the launcher options (actually everything is maxed out here Messing around It seems when I have Rudy ENB (or any other ENB) enabled, there isn't any fire. I still get the "blur" effect, and enemies still catch on fire, but you can't see any fire in spells, torches, campfires, places on fire (such as Helgen), or any other instances where there should be fire. I've already tried the following: iMultiSample=0, iMaxAnisotropy=0, bFXAAEnabled=0, bFloatPointRenderTarget=1 Turning off and on Antialiasing Having the latest ENBseries Using the Unofficial Skyrim Patch Getti. I'm not new in Skyrim modding, but sometimes I'm perplexed by people, using AntiFreeze Patch 9 (ENBSeries v0.096) ( and even recommending it together with normal ENBSeries versions (0.2XX, 0.3XX and so on). I personally think it's obsolete and not needed, but their incredible persistence confuses me. Well, maybe I'm wrong? Maybe ENB AntiFreeze Patch is't an old and useless stuff. 
Version of this tutorial: v1.1b Hello, this sub seems to be a great fan of Skyrim, and i see everybody is using graphical mods. What i seem to notice is that people often forget to use the other great piece of work by our friend Boris (creator of ENB series) called ENB Patch. it aims to improve several aspects of the games that get this glorious tool. now let's go and do it. with this i assume you have some very basic computer knowledge and a brain. 1 - Firstly, jump to http://enbdev.com/pa. recently I set up my skyrim with mod organizer. I was using vividian ENB and I noticed how the spell particles were missing. After some (poorly done) research, I installed ENB ANTIFREEZE patch ( ). This did nothing so I removed the files and reinstalled the old ENB files. Now, however, the bethesda logo doesnt show up, the ENB text in the top right hand corner doesnt show up and the skyrim logo appears briefly before the game crashes. I'm playing a light armor character, and at one point I just stopped having stamina drain when running. I thought maybe it was some feature when my skill got high enough. Then I started noticing how heavily armored bandits move the same speed as I do. A put on some heavy armor from a silver hand member I killed, I was a lot slower due to having too much weight on me. When I shed the extra pounds, however, I moved at the normal speed through the whole stamina bar. The only other I was playing through Skyrim, and suddenly my performance went to absolute hell when it shouldn't have. On top of that, my fire and frostbite spells became invisible. It seems like these two problems get linked often. I tried the ENB antifreeze patch, I tried updating my drivers, and I installed some .ini files from the nexus that were supposed to end microstuttering. Nothing worked. I'm hoping someone else has a last resort fix before I have to reinstall skyrim for the 104036th time.

Try refreshing your device and reinstalling all windows updates BEFORE attaching a type or touch keyboard. This fixed all of my nVidia issues. I ve heard that having. With regards to ‘not fit for purpose’, I purchased a laptop almost a year ago which works fine, however ever since I started using it, it has given me electric.
