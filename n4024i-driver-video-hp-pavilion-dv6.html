I can wake it up no problem, though sometimes it crashes again when it tries to load the game up again. Those situations usually end in a never-ending loop of load-crash-reboot that requires me to hardfail it. Starting games up in windowed mode has absolutely zero problems though, and it doesn't matter

I'm running an HP Pavilion dv6 laptop with Windows 7. Sometimes my screen goes black (still on though) for no reason. It's sort of flickering between a lighter and darker black while it does this and I can see it's brighter toward the bottom. I can increase and decrease the brightness still, but nothing else I've done works - opening and closing the lid, refreshing the screen, going to the task manager. After a few minutes, it stops and works fine, and my screen is how I left it. This happe.

This is especially bothersome with videos that include text. I have looked for this problem elsewhere, to no avail.

Hi, I tried to install Ubuntu a bit of time ago (dual boot with Windows 8) and I succesfully did it, but the problem is I have a HP Pavilion G6 and (I searched on the Internet and almost all HP g6/dv6 are affected by this problem) it used to heat SO MUCH more than Windows, with the fan at maximum speed and super-hot while doing nothing with my PC.
